# Tetris
The classic game of Tetris, but really ugly and with spaghetti code **I mean high quality code**.
Mostly follows the official Tetris game rules, based on the older versions that don't allow rotating/grace time after quickdrops. I made this a while ago, so I forget if I included T spin points or some of the other wierder interactions with rotating in cramped spaces.
